#Boombot Scripts

####Optional Scripts for [Boombot](https://github.com/TerrordactylDesigns/boombot)

###For V2.0.0 which is still currently under development

###About

I wanted to make scripts a little more community driven. Every time I
see the modifications people have done to my scripts it made me want to
have a place to share everyones personal touches. Here it is.....

###How to install

* Phase 1 - download
* Phase 2 - copy the scripts you want into your Boombot's scripts dir
* Phase 3 - ????
* Phase 4 - profit.

###Write some of your own!

example.script.js in the examples directory will point you to your new
addiction... Each script will require the 3 exports and the header
comments/information. An example of ttapi's data return that is sent
in to the script function is also provided.

###Fork me? Fork you!

Made a script? Is it cool? Of course it is! So fork the damn repo and
send me a pull request with your gift to the world. Go down in the
history of Boombot as the guy who wrote that script that everyone loves!
